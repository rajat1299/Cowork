# Markdown Document Policy

1. Convert user intent into a concrete document outline.
2. Produce a complete markdown artifact in the working directory.
3. Ensure headings/lists/tables are valid and readable.
4. Return the final output path.

Validation:
- The file must end with `.md`.
- The content should include at least one heading and one paragraph.
