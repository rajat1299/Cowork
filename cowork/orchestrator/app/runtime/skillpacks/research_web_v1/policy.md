# Research Web Policy

Use a procedural research loop:
1. Build 3-5 focused queries from the request.
2. Search and capture candidate links.
3. Remove duplicate domains and low-signal pages.
4. Extract specific claims with citations.
5. If the deliverable is large, save findings to a file in the workdir.

Recovery rules:
- If results are sparse, broaden query terms.
- If results are noisy, narrow with entity + year constraints.
- If one source fails, continue with alternate corroborating sources.
